Introduction into microcontrollers

## Purpose
This repository is used to track my progress in learning about microcontrollers.

I will be uploading all my tutorials and projects to this repository as I go along.

## Tutorials
 - Tutorial 1
 	- Make a LED flash using assembly to create a delay for roughly 1 second
 - Tutorial 2
 	- Create a flashing LED using C
 		- Flashes every second
 - Tutorial 3
 	- Up/Down counter
 		- Count up every 200ms when button 1 is pressed down
 		- Count down every 200ms when button 2 is pressed down
 		- When no buttons are pressed, keep last count and flash it every 100ms
 		- When both buttons are pressed, reset
 - Tutorial 4
 	- Light switch dimmer using PWM
 		- Increase duty cycle
 		- Decrease duty cycle
 		- Increase frequency
 		- Decrease frequency
 - Tutorial 5
 	- Volt meter
 		- Use BCD
 		- Display values on 4 LED's
 - Tutorial 6
 	- Volt Meter
 		- Use BCD
 		- Display values on a 7 segment display
 - Tutorial 7
	- Volt Meter
		- Accurate to 2 decimal places
		- Display to LCD display
 - Tutorial 8
 	- Use RS232 to display a message on a PC
 	- Use an LCD to display whatever is typed on the PC
 - Tutorial 9
 	- Make use of an interrupt to distrupt and continue a program

## Projects
 - List of projects (To be populated)

## Final project
Is still yet to be decided. For now it looks like I will be attempting the Wireless relay switch.

###Possible ideas
 - Pads which when hit play specific tracks on a PC
 - Wireless relay switch
 - Temperature Sensor
