Introduction into microcontrollers

## Purpose
This repository is used to track my progress in learning about microcontrollers.

I will be uploading all my tutorials and projects to this repository as I go along.

## Tutorials
 - Tutorial 1
 	- Make a LED flash using assembly to create a delay for roughly 1 second
 - Tutorial 2
 	- Create a flashing LED using C
 		- Flashes every second
 - Tutorial 3
 	- Up/Down counter
 		- Count up every 200ms when button 1 is pressed down
 		- Count down every 200ms when button 2 is pressed down
 		- When no buttons are pressed, keep last count and flash it every 100ms
 		- When both buttons are pressed, reset

## Projects
